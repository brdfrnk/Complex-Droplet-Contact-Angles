#Droplet Contact Angle Determination
Determination of comples Janus droplet contact angle automatically.

This code takes sideview optical micrographs of complex emulsion droplets with visible edges and internal interface and determines the contact angle with simple geometry and a little math.

To use: open up either file and use its corresponding example picture. For the similar radii case, the program will ask you to trace the radii of one droplet.
